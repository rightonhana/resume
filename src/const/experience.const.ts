				personalImpact: "Took ownership of the Web Application, implemented internationalization strategy from scratch. Do the migration from Angular 7 to Angular 12 and implemented a tool to generate models and types base on the API Swagger. Doing the internationalization work I found some API architectural errors where the translations were distributed in different places with duplicated values instead to be centralized."

				personalImpact: "Once I started working on this project I did some debugging on the code that was written before I was hired, and I found critical bugs on production that the client wasn't aware of, related to video decoding. This made me a key member of the team pretty early on with this client. Similarly to the other project for RealEyes Media, I introduced some new features and good practices with TypeScript."

				personalImpact: "The project had components with 2000+ lines of code, so as a newcomer to the project I noticed that the ramp-up process wasn't the best and the maintenance of those huge components wasn't ideal either, so I proposed to split those components into smaller parts to make them easier to maintain. There was some push-back initially, but after 1 sprint we started working on code splitting."

				personalImpact: "I introduced UX best practices from the coding side to the project. My teammates weren't aware of some practices to improve the accessibility of a WebApp like adding area-labels or titles attributes for screen readers, having a good contrast (AA or AAA), the importance of typography sizes, the importance of colors for action buttons (for example a cancel button should be red, never blue or green), and so on. I also helped with some TypeScript and Angular good practices and introduced some new features to the team."

This improved the accessibility of the app drastically."

				personalImpact: "I had to learn Angular by myself in less than 2 weeks because the clients initially wanted to have a React app, but then they changed their minds and chose Angular instead. Besides that, I introduced some good practices to my teammates about semantic HTML, like using the strong tag instead of bold, or the emphasis tag instead of italic, which has a good impact for screen readers."
